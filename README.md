# Snake Game Project
I started a Snake game project, which will serve two main purposes for me:

1. **Getting into Pygame library**: Through this project, I pretend to get hands-on experience with the Pygame library, allowing me to create projects with graphical user interfaces (UI). For example how to represent grids, windows, and other UI elements, which  will expand my capabilities as a developer.

2. **Learning version control**: Learn the version control system to maintain a structured workflow and ensure projects are readable for others. By using Git, I'll be able to track my progress and maintain a well-documented history of my projects.

# GitHub Repositories

I use my GitHub repositories to track my progress and showcase my skills. These repositories serve as a representation of my growth as a developer and can be used as a part of my resume when applying for jobs. I believe they provide valuable insights into my coding abilities, thought process and the projects I have worked on.

I invite you to explore my GitHub repositories to get a better understanding of my coding abilities and the projects I have completed. I am open to job opportunities and would be thrilled to discuss any potential collaborations.
